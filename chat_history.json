Implement the category and distance filters.\n3.  **Create an event detail screen:** Create a new file `app/event/[id].tsx` to display the details of a selected event.\n4.  **Update the tab layout:** Modify `app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx` to ensure proper navigation.\n\nAfter the coding agent implements the plan, the modalDemos array from app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx should be removed.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-07T18:22:36.895809"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build a local event finder app!

I've successfully created a local event finder app with the following features:\n\n## **Features Implemented:**\n\n### **1. Event Data Structure**\n- Created `app/data/events.ts` with a comprehensive event interface and sample data\n- 10 sample events across different categories (Music, Sports, Arts, Food, Technology, Business, Health, Education, Entertainment)\n- Each event includes: title, category, distance, description, date, time, location, image, and price\n\n### **2. Home Screen with Filtering**\n- **Search functionality**: Users can search events by title or description\n- **Category filters**: Horizontal scrollable category buttons (All, Music, Sports, Arts, etc.)\n- **Distance filters**: Quick distance selection (5, 10, 25, 50 miles)\n- **Event cards**: Beautiful cards showing event images, key info, and category badges\n- **Results counter**: Shows how many events match the current filters\n\n### **3. Event Detail Screen**\n- **Dynamic routing**: `/event/[id]` for individual event pages\n- **Rich event information**: Full event details with icons for date, time, location, distance, and price\n- **High-quality images**: Event photos from Unsplash\n- **Interest button**: \"I'm Interested\" call-to-action\n- **Proper navigation**: Back button with contrasting colors\n\n### **4. Updated Design System**\n- **Color scheme**: Updated `styles/commonStyles.ts` with the specified colors:\n  - Background: `#f9f9f9`\n  - Text: `#212121`\n  - TextSecondary: `#757575`\n  - Primary: `#3f51b5`\n  - Secondary: `#f44336`\n  - Accent: `#ff9800`\n  - Card: `#ffffff`\n  - Highlight: `#e0e0e0`\n\n### **5.

Users can browse events, filter by category and distance, search for specific events, and view detailed information about each event. The design is modern, clean, and follows the specified color scheme throughout the application."}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-10-07T18:22:25Z"}]
